## Introduction

I really love the game Hollow Knight, and it inspired me to create this demonstration of experimental technology (as of 2024) using `animation-timeline: scroll();` 😊

Hollow Knight is a beautifully crafted action-adventure game developed by Team Cherry. Its intricate world, challenging gameplay, and captivating storyline have left a lasting impression on many players.

By the way, if you’d like to learn more about Hollow Knight, you can check out the official website or dive into the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/). Enjoy your journey through the mysterious and enchanting world of Hallownest! 🌟🗡️🌟

## Review

This demo works well on widescreen, but on mobile devices it loses the details of the animation.

Creating responsive designs that adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes can be quite challenging. It’s essential to consider both large displays and smaller devices to ensure a consistent user experience.
